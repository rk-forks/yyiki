Git-based wiki written in Python

# Design principles

As yyiki is designed as a personal wiki software, simplicity is the primary principle as described below:

- Markdown: yyiki only supports markdown, which is probably one of the most widely used and versatile document format. 
- Git and flatfiles: yyiki is also a git repository. This removes the complexity of database and makes back up straightforward.
